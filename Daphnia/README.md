# Postdoctoral Research: Daphnia Analysis

This project involves various analyses related to Daphnia, focusing on metabolomics and RNA sequencing during my postdoctoral research.

## Scripts Included

- **Daphnia_Metabolomics_Analysis.R**  
  This script performs analysis on metabolomics data collected from Daphnia samples. It includes data cleaning, normalization, and visualization steps.

- **Daphnia_RNA_Analysis**  
  This directory contains scripts for analyzing RNA sequencing data from Daphnia samples. It covers quality control, alignment, differential expression analysis, and visualization of results.

- **Nextflow-Daphnia Multiomics Analysis**  
  This is a Nextflow pipeline designed for multi-omics analysis of Daphnia data. It orchestrates the integration of metabolomics and RNA sequencing data for a more comprehensive analysis.

Feel free to explore the scripts and methods used in the analysis!
