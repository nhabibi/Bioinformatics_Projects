## üìÑ Overview
Recombinant protein production is a significant biotechnological process as it allows researchers to produce a specific protein in desired quantities. **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** is the most popular heterologous expression host for the production of recombinant proteins due to its advantages such as:
- Low cost  
- High productivity  
- Well-characterized genetics  
- Simple growth requirements  
- Rapid growth  

There are several factors that influence the expression level of a recombinant protein in **E. coli**, including:  
- **The gene** to be expressed  
- **The expression vector** used  
- **The expression host**  
- **The culture conditions**  

The major motivation to develop the database, **EcoliOverExpressionDB**, is to provide a means for researchers to quickly locate key factors in the overexpression of specific proteins. This information serves as a **useful guide** for the overexpression of similar proteins in **E. coli**.

To the best of the researchers' knowledge, **EcoliOverExpressionDB** is the **first database** that gathers influential parameters on protein overexpression and the associated results in a single, accessible place.

## üß™ **Key Concepts**
- **Recombinant Protein Production**: Producing target proteins in large amounts using host organisms like E. coli.  
- **Heterologous Expression Host**: An organism used to express a protein that does not naturally occur in it.  
- **Expression Factors**: Elements that affect the success of recombinant protein production (gene, vector, host, culture).
