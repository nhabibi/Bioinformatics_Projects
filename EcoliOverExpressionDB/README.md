# EcoliOverExpressionDB

This project is part of my PhD thesis, focusing on recombinant protein production using **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** as the expression host. 

## Overview
**EcoliOverExpressionDB** is a database designed to help researchers quickly find key factors influencing recombinant protein overexpression in **E. coli**. It includes information on:
- The gene to be expressed
- The expression vector
- The expression host
- The culture conditions

This database provides valuable guidance for optimizing protein expression in **E. coli**.

## Key Concepts
- **Recombinant Protein Production**: Producing target proteins in E. coli.
- **Heterologous Expression Host**: Organisms used to express foreign proteins.
- **Expression Factors**: Key elements affecting protein production success.

## Reference
**Original Article**: [Recombinant protein overexpression in Escherichia coli - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24333540/)
